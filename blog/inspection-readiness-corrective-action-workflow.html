      <h1>Inspection readiness without promises: corrective actions + evidence + closure</h1>

      <p class="lead">Inspection readiness is an operations workflow, not a claim. The only defensible approach is to remediate the actual issues, document what changed, and close the loop with evidence you can retrieve on demand.</p>

      <h2>From inspection risk to controlled workflow</h2>
      <p>When inspection risk spikes, most teams scramble. A controlled workflow looks like this:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Open a priority work order</strong> with scope, owner, and time window.</li>
        <li><strong>Run a targeted checklist</strong> aligned to the specific risk areas (BOH, FOH, hood/docs, storage).</li>
        <li><strong>Capture evidence</strong> for completion (photos, logs, certificates).</li>
        <li><strong>Log exceptions as corrective actions</strong> with owners and due dates.</li>
        <li><strong>Close only with evidence</strong> and keep the package retrievable.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>This is the operational pattern GroundOps runs through <a href="/platform">the platform</a> and <a href="/vendor-management">vendor management</a> so readiness is auditable across locations.</p>

      <h2>Corrective action logs: ownership and closure</h2>
      <p>If an issue doesn’t have an owner and due date, it’s not being managed. A corrective action log is where exceptions go to become owned work with closure requirements.</p>

      <h3>Example artifact: corrective action log excerpt (redacted)</h3>
      <div class="table-wrapper" role="region" aria-label="Corrective action log excerpt">
        <table class="comparison-table" role="table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Location</th>
              <th>Corrective action</th>
              <th>Owner</th>
              <th>Due</th>
              <th>Closure evidence</th>
              <th>Status</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Location 2</td>
              <td>Drain area buildup requires pull-out + re-checklist</td>
              <td>Ops</td>
              <td>—</td>
              <td>Before/after photos + checklist re-run</td>
              <td>Dispatched</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Location 4</td>
              <td>Missing hood documentation for last service (NFPA records)</td>
              <td>Vendor</td>
              <td>—</td>
              <td>Certificate uploaded + record linked</td>
              <td>Open</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Location 1</td>
              <td>Recurring grease behind equipment (access constraint documented)</td>
              <td>Vendor</td>
              <td>—</td>
              <td>Photo set + exception marked “repeat”</td>
              <td>Open</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <h2>Evidence required to pass repeat inspections</h2>
      <p>Evidence isn’t “nice to have.” It’s what prevents the same exception from reappearing as “he said/she said.” The evidence package should be consistent and retrievable.</p>

      <h3>Example artifact: evidence checklist fields</h3>
      <div class="table-wrapper" role="region" aria-label="Evidence checklist fields">
        <table class="comparison-table" role="table">

            <tr>
              <th>Evidence item</th>
              <th>Required when</th>
              <th>Stored as</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Checklist completion</td>
              <td>Every visit</td>
              <td>Checklist record linked to work order</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Photo evidence (key risk areas)</td>
              <td>Deep cleans, inspection readiness, repeat exceptions</td>
              <td>Timestamped photos attached to work order</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Exception notes + corrective action owner</td>
              <td>Any miss or constraint</td>
              <td>Exception log entry with owner + due date</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>NFPA / compliance certificate (if applicable)</td>
              <td>Hood/exhaust documentation needs</td>
              <td>Certificate stored and linked to location record</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Closure confirmation</td>
              <td>When corrective action is resolved</td>
              <td>Closed status + evidence required to close</td>
