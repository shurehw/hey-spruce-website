      <h1>Multi-location QA that scales: checklists, photo evidence, exception logs, and scorecards</h1>

      <p class="lead">If QA lives in texts, emails, and “looks good” drive-bys, it won’t scale. Multi-location ops need a single system that turns every visit into documented outputs, and every miss into a tracked exception with ownership and closure.</p>

      <h2>The minimum viable QA loop</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Checklist</strong>: define the standard and confirm completion (per location, per scope).</li>
        <li><strong>Photo evidence</strong>: prove completion for the items that matter.</li>
        <li><strong>Exception log</strong>: capture misses as corrective actions (owner + due date).</li>
        <li><strong>Scorecards</strong>: roll up performance by location and vendor so ops can spot repeat issues.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Exception logs: turning misses into owned actions</h2>
      <p>Exceptions are not “notes.” They are work. The rule is simple: if it matters enough to mention, it matters enough to assign, due-date, and close with evidence.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Write the exception like a ticket</strong>: what, where, and the constraint (access, equipment not movable, missing parts).</li>
        <li><strong>Assign an owner</strong>: vendor, ops, maintenance, or manager.</li>
        <li><strong>Set a due date</strong>: even if it’s a placeholder pending parts—no due date means no priority.</li>
        <li><strong>Define closure evidence</strong>: what proof is required to mark it closed (photos, re-checklist, certificate).</li>
        <li><strong>Mark repeats explicitly</strong>: repeated exceptions are a leadership signal, not a cleaning task.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Monthly scorecards: what leadership actually reviews</h2>
      <p>Leadership doesn’t review 1,000 photos. They review a scorecard that shows whether execution is happening and where the system is failing. If you can’t roll QA up to a few ops metrics, it won’t stay funded.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Completion %</strong> tells whether scheduled work is closing as planned.</li>
        <li><strong>Rework %</strong> tells whether “closed” really meant “done.”</li>
        <li><strong>Repeat exceptions</strong> tells where the same issues recur (location, vendor, or scope problem).</li>
        <li><strong>Median time-to-close</strong> tells whether issues are being resolved or just logged.</li>
        <li><strong>SLA adherence</strong> (per agreement) tells whether response/closure targets are being met by priority class.</li>
      </ul>
